# text-to-image-GenerativeAI


Like previous project I am scanning the pdf file and extracting text from it. Then sending it to the gemini and in response it is sending back the title and summary(500 words). Using the Title, image is generated by the another model used of Hugging Face (stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0) and all the three Title, Summary and image url is saved in the database.
